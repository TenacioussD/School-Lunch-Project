# School-Lunch-Project

We collectively decided to create a lunch ordering system application to provide a simplistic and efficient ordering platform that parents can use to order the student’s lunches. 

We have included an admin login so that authorized personnel can make modifications to the lunch menu, including the ability to change passwords, view orders, authorize users, and remove or block users for various reasons.

System Requirements/Layout of Menus:

MAIN MENU:
•	User login for parents/students (3 attempts to login)
•	Registration page for new users
•	Admin login (for authorized users)
•	Exit

ADMIN MENU:
•	View orders/Generate receipts
•	Change user details
•	New registrations (with the ability to approve or decline a user depending on whether they are relevant to the system)
•	Remove users for various reasons

USER MENU:
•	View menu items and add items to order
•	Place orders
•	Choice of payment methods
•	Section to add a discount code
